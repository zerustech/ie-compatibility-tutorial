# Internet Explorer Compatibilities
No matter if you are a web developer, or just a user, you have to deal with the
compatibility issues of variant browsers, from time to time.

Among all the browsers, Internet Explorer (IE for short) is the most complicated
one to deal with. We are not going to explain the reasons here, however, I bet
you already knew what I am talking about.

Fortunately, the IE developers have been awared of the issues and they have been
improving it in each release. Now, quite a few features can be used on IE to
provide better user exprience in regards with compatibilities.

When speaking of the compatibility of a browser, we are actually talking about
two things: 1) the compatibility with the W3C standards; or 2) the
compatibilities between releases;

In this tutorial, we will discuss the latter for IE11 on Windows 10, which is
the latest release at the time of documentation.
